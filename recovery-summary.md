# System Recovery Status

## Fixed Issues âœ…
- Price fetching now uses real CoinGecko API data
- Arbitrage detection working correctly (finding $16-24 profit opportunities)
- Emergency price fallback system implemented
- Wasteful ETH transfers to 0x742d35Cc6E4c4530D4B0b7c4c8e5e3B7F6E8e9f0 stopped

## Current Status
- **Contract ETH**: 0.0003 ETH (~$0.80) recoverable via withdrawal
- **Wallet ETH**: 0.000086 ETH (insufficient for gas)
- **Arbitrage Detection**: Working (finding legitimate opportunities)
- **Execution**: Blocked by insufficient funds

## Real Arbitrage Opportunities Found
Recent legitimate opportunities detected:
- USDC/USDT: Buy $0.997685, Sell $1.002971 = $24.07 profit
- WETH/USDT: Various spreads = $16-17 profit
- LINK/USDC: Price differences across DEXs

## Recovery Steps
1. Add ~0.0002 ETH to wallet 0xa4Cadc8C3b9Ec33E1053F3309A4bAABc2c8a8895 for gas
2. Use Emergency ETH Recovery in Auto Mode tab to withdraw 0.0003 ETH from contract
3. Total recovered: ~0.0005 ETH (~$1.20)
4. Add additional ETH to test real arbitrage execution

## System Ready For Testing
The arbitrage logic is now functional and finding real opportunities. Once funded, it will execute actual blockchain transactions instead of demo hashes.
